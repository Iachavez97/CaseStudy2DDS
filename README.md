# CaseStudy2DDS
## Hello CEO and CFO of Frito Lay the purpose of this exploratory data analysis was to take the CaseStudy2 dataset and answer some statistical questions. Within this code we have provided graphs, analysis, and answers to the following questions. Build a model to predict attrition? Building a model to predict monthly income? As well as finding a relation between job role and monthly income. Adressed if there were any missing values and if there were any outlier values. Through a knn model I was able to build a model that would predict attrition with a 80% accuracy. Additionally, I built a multiple linear regression model that would predict the monthly income based on variables JobLevel, TotalWorkingYears, YearsWithCurrManager, and DistanceFromHome. Lastly I looked into if there was any realtion between job level and monthly income and how the monthly income value differed between each position. I hope that all of your questions will be answered, but if not feel free to reach out to us for further explanation, thank you for your time.
